A fun fact about me is that I was in a high school production of High School Musical on Stage and got to meet Corbin Bleu! Also I have a tattoo of a pretzel. "

			"paragraph": "Laughing makes me happy. The most intimate reaction from a person is laughter. I considered myself awkward in most social situations. Every time I enter a conversation with someone I don’t know, I become very self-conscious. Growing up in a family that didn’t speak English meant that I was isolated from the world. My parents didn’t understand school activities and had no time to take me to them. Living with a culture that values isolation, I never developed a drive to connect and talk to people. I spent many years keeping to myself, but I knew I had to change. When entering Speech and Debate, in the beginning, I was able to keep to myself. Just go to the meeting, sit in the back, and then leave when it was over. Yet over time, I was forced to interact. For me, it has always been uncomfortable to talk to people, but I never realized, everyone else feels that way as well. One day, I made a joke about an awkward situation and everybody laughed. That day, I made more friends than I’d ever had. Ever since that day, I have used humor to connect with people. Now, I’ve realized that humor is a tool for me to grow myself socially, emotionally, and academically. I joined the Theatre company to express my feelings through humor. I began teaching because I found new ways to connect with everyone. I am happy when people laugh because I have created a genuine connection. Other things I do around campus is that AFROTC and TCU Senate!"
